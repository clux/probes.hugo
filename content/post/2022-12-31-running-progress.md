In an attempt to torture my chair shaped husk of a body, I ran a lot this year. Trained for months and ran almost 2500km in total - to take part in a big Half Marathon in London. It become a routine to run around 70km per week, and beat pretty much all my earlier endurance records in the process as my VO2max estimate shot up. This post is just notes for myself about the year.

## Milestones

The good parts first; PBs:

- ~~[41:51 on 10k on 08 Jun](https://www.strava.com/activities/7274508726)~~
- [11:15 on 3k on 28 Sep](https://www.strava.com/activities/7878906931/overview)
- [39:29 on 10k on 04 Sep](https://www.strava.com/activities/7750969909/overview)
- [1:29:34 on HM on 09 Oct](https://www.strava.com/activities/7934772777#21922284308)

A `3200m Cooper test` also puts me, [heuristically](https://exrx.net/Calculators/MinuteRun), in the VO2max 60 range.

## Q1/Q2

Year started slow. Increased fast without muscle training and ended up spending a lot more time on an elliptical in February.
In London, when my foot muscles started catching up, and the remote work setup got predictable, I was able to raise the mileage quite a bit come summer (with an avg of 60k weekly in July). This gave me confidence to start a pretty ambitious training plan from the end of July.

### Q3; London Parks Half Training

Average 71k weekly mileage during this block.

| Week | Mileage | VO2max | Fast      |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | --------- |
| *1*  | 60k     | 56     | 6k (10%)  |
| *2*  | 61k     | 56     | 7k (11%)  |
| *3*  | 66k     | 56     | 11k (17%) |
| *4*  | 67k     | 57     | 14k (20%) |
| *5*  | 74k     | 57     | 13k (17%) |
| *6*  | 79k     | 56     | 14k (18%) |
| *7*  | 69k     | 57     | 20k (29%) |
| *8*  | 79k     | 57     | 10k (13%) |
| *9*  | 77k     | 57     | 17k (22%) |
| *10* | 89k     | 58     | 24k (27%) |
| *11* | 79k     | 58     | 17k (21%) |
| *12* | 57k     | 58     | 25k (44%) |

with my specific notes for each week:

- *1*; `6x1k` at ~4:10/km moltemyr (not overly hard), 60km
- *2*; `6x400m` at 3:32/km (aimed for 1:24) + 20min fast `lyslÃ¸ypa`, 61km
- *3*; `4x1M` at 4:05/km greenwhich (400m rec)+ `1x5k` at 4:15 track, 66km
- *4*; `4x1M` at 4:04/km again + `fartlek ~5k`, swapped 10k race for 6k+20k long with `3k`@4:15, 67k
- *5*: `5x1k` at 3:45/km, `5k` at 4:08, minor `hills`, 74k
- *6*: `8x500m` at 3:42/km, `5k` at 4:35, `5k` at 4:08 in long run, 77k
- *7*: `8x1k` at 4:09/km (had a stitch), `6x1min` at 3:29, 10k race at 3:57, 69k
- *8*: `6x1k` at 4:09/km, 10x1min at 3:40/km, 1k@4:18 (long), 79k
- *9*: `2x2k`+ `2x1500` at 4:04, 8k at 4:15 in long run, 77k
- *10*: `2x3k`+`2x2k` at 4:07 + 2x2x400m at 3:30 + 10k at 4:15 in long run, 89k
- *11*: 5krace attempt (4) + 4x1M at 4:01, 6k at 4:15 in long run (big headwind), 79k
- *12* taper week (intensive, but short mileage 60%, muscle monday only, 2k speed, 2k hills) + HM, 57k

By many metrics I peaked nicely for the race:

#### Pace Zones

Calculated the following zonal pace estimates for me based on the general fitness during this time:

- 3:32/km -> 17km/h ~= Z6 for mile?
- 3:45/km -> 16km/h ~= Z5 for 5k (18:45)
- 4:00/km -> 15km/h ~= Z4 for 10k (40:00)
- 4:16/km -> 14.1km/h ~= Z3 for HM (1:29:47)
- 5:00/km -> 12km/h ~= Z2

### Recovery

2 weeks of pretty low effort (40k, 50k), no speed, run every other day.

### Chiang Mai Half Training

This training, while fun to translate across continents in week 3 to a new humid environment, did not end as positively.

- *1*: [`6x1k` at 4:00/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8016708080), [19k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8042805169), 67k
- *2*: [`7x1k` at 3:57/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8052372984), [21k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8071743943), 80k
- *3*: [`3.5x1M` at 4:05/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8084716741), [700m climb long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8109412998), 72k
- *4*: [`4x1M at 4:05/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8124189835), [20k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8142151676), 85k
- *5*: [`4x1M at 4:03/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8155702793), [22k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8173542205), 92k
- *6*: 8K recovery week, [8k MAF test](https://www.strava.com/activities/8187100758), and covid ðŸª¦, 38k

So that kind of put a stop to the race on the scheduled a mere two weeks ahead. Based on [many](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/xr60mg/an_athletes_guide_to_managing_covid_risks_by_matt/), [warnings](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/yn5ypp/tested_covid_positive_10_days_before_a_marathon/) from r/advanced_running.

On the positive side, I kind of dreaded the 4AM start for this race anyway (tropical climate is hard to run in), so having to cancel is not all that negative.

### Covid

One year since my last vaccination shot - and probably being hit with one of the `Q` variants in southeast asia - this disease was not fun. Just as the one symptom disappeared another came in to replace it. While my stress graph on the worst day was only comparable to a stomach bug, my partner's stress graph on Garmin was the worst I have ever seen (with 16 hours of high stress).

BMJ has a [Graduated Return To Play Guidance Protocol](https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2022/04/23/graduated-return-to-play-after-sars-cov-2-infection-what-have-we-learned-and-why-weve-updated-the-guidance/) and based on only some "below-the-neck" systemic symptoms (fever), I am only planning on doing light jogging during the second half of December once it's possible to:

> complete all activities of daily living without excessive fatigue and/or breathlessness and be able to walk on the flat without getting breathless

## Random Thoughts

The silliest things about this "accessible sport" is the amount of shoes you burn through.. If you run 100k a week, and follow the 500-600k recommendation for max shoe mileage, you'll blast through 5-10 pairs of running shoes a year, costing you somewhere from 500-2000 pounds a year without discounts. The `Â£60` I paid to run in Royal Parks was actually worth it just for the `15% off` coupon at a running shoe store.
