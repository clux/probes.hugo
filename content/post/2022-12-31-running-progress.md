In an attempt to torture my chair shaped husk of a body, I ran a lot this year. Trained for months and ran almost 2500km in total - to take part in a big Half Marathon in London. It become a routine to run around 70km per week, and beat pretty much all my earlier endurance records in the process as my VO2max estimate shot up. This post is just notes for myself about the year.

## Milestones

The good parts first; PBs:

- ~~[41:51 on 10k on 08 Jun](https://www.strava.com/activities/7274508726)~~
- [11:15 on 3k on 28 Sep](https://www.strava.com/activities/7878906931/overview)
- [39:29 on 10k on 04 Sep](https://www.strava.com/activities/7750969909/overview)
- [1:29:34 on HM on 09 Oct](https://www.strava.com/activities/7934772777#21922284308)

The 3k PB is also a `3200m Cooper test` which, [heuristically](https://exrx.net/Calculators/MinuteRun), puts my VO2max above 60. Something for next year to try out properly perhaps.

## Q1/Q2

Year started slow. Increased fast without muscle training and ended up spending a lot more time on an elliptical in February.
In London, when my foot muscles started catching up, and the remote work setup got predictable, I was able to raise the mileage quite a bit come summer (with an average of 60k weekly in July). This gave me confidence to start a pretty ambitious training plan from the end of July.

### Q3; London Parks Half Training

Combined ideas from two generally available training plans:

- [AgeUk's Sub 1:30 12w](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/contentassets/73784215f4ee46beb3d357eed3fdcc31/sub-1_30_half_marathon_training_schedules.pdf) with Mileage 56-75km, 1 speed sesh/w 
- [NSPCC Sub 1:30 14w](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/support-us/training-gym/running-plans/half-marathon/20171301-pe-training-sheet-2018_half-marathon-sub-1.30-aw2.pdf) unclear mileage, 2 speed sesh/w

and incorporated ~two sessions of muscle strength training a week (single leg dead lifts, weighted squats, hungarian squats, heel/soleus raises, plus misc core/oblique strength exercises). Ended up averaging `71k` weekly mileage during this block.

| Week | Mileage | VO2max | Fast      |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | --------- |
| *1*  | 60k     | 56     | 6k (10%)  |
| *2*  | 61k     | 56     | 7k (11%)  |
| *3*  | 66k     | 56     | 11k (17%) |
| *4*  | 67k     | 57     | 14k (20%) |
| *5*  | 74k     | 57     | 13k (17%) |
| *6*  | 79k     | 56     | 14k (18%) |
| *7*  | 69k     | 57     | 20k (29%) |
| *8*  | 79k     | 57     | 10k (13%) |
| *9*  | 77k     | 57     | 17k (22%) |
| *10* | 89k     | 58     | 24k (27%) |
| *11* | 79k     | 58     | 17k (21%) |
| *12* | 57k     | 58     | 24k (42%) |

where VO2max is the Garmin estimate. Never actually measured this properly.

By many metrics (Garmin VO2max estimate, Strava fitness), I peaked nicely for the race:

![](/imgs/running22/fitness-hm.png)

and ended up feeling OK after the race. One blood-shot big toenail (which i could show off for a whole year - if such a thing was considered cool).

#### Pace Zones

Calculated the following zonal pace estimates for me based on the general fitness during this time:

- 3:32/km -> 17km/h ~= Z6 for mile?
- 3:45/km -> 16km/h ~= Z5 for 5k (18:45)
- 4:00/km -> 15km/h ~= Z4 for 10k (40:00)
- 4:16/km -> 14.1km/h ~= Z3 for HM (1:29:47)
- 5:00/km -> 12km/h ~= Z2

#### Recovery

2 weeks of pretty low effort (40k, 50k), no speed, run every other day.

### Chiang Mai Half Training

This training, while fun to translate across continents in week 3 to a new humid environment, did not end as positively.

- *1*: [`6x1k` at 4:00/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8016708080), [19k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8042805169), 67k
- *2*: [`7x1k` at 3:57/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8052372984), [21k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8071743943), 80k
- *3*: [`3.5x1M` at 4:05/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8084716741), [700m climb long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8109412998), 72k
- *4*: [`4x1M at 4:05/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8124189835), [20k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8142151676), 85k
- *5*: [`4x1M at 4:03/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8155702793), [22k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8173542205), 92k
- *6*: 8K recovery week, [8k MAF test](https://www.strava.com/activities/8187100758), and covid ðŸª¦, 38k

So that kind of put a stop to the race on the scheduled a mere two weeks ahead. The r/advanced_running subreddit had [ample](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/xr60mg/an_athletes_guide_to_managing_covid_risks_by_matt/), [warnings](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/yn5ypp/tested_covid_positive_10_days_before_a_marathon/) about running hard post-covid.

On the positive side, with a dreaded `4AM start` for this race and 90% average humidity (which tanked my running efficiency), having to cancel a difficult masochistic exercise you set purely for yourself, is not universally negative. It's also nice to get some extra recovery time for my legs.

### Covid

Unfortunately, it had been one full year since my last (3rd) vaccination shot - and along with probably being hit with one of the `Q` variants in southeast asia - this disease was not fun. Just as the one symptom disappeared another came in to replace it. While my stress graph on the worst day was only comparable to a stomach bug, my partner's stress graph on Garmin was the worst I have ever seen (with 16 hours of high stress).

BMJ has a [Graduated Return To Play Guidance Protocol](https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2022/04/23/graduated-return-to-play-after-sars-cov-2-infection-what-have-we-learned-and-why-weve-updated-the-guidance/) and based on only having some "below-the-neck" systemic symptoms (fever), I am only planning on doing light jogging during the second half of December once it's possible to:

> complete all activities of daily living without excessive fatigue and/or breathlessness and be able to walk on the flat without getting breathless

Use your masks while indoors people. [Each time you get reinfected, the risks increase](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/repeat-covid-is-riskier-than-first-infection-study-finds-2022-11-10/).

## Random Thoughts

### Shoes

The silliest things about this "accessible sport" is the amount of shoes you burn through.. If you run 100k a week, and follow the 500-600k recommendation for max shoe mileage, you'll blast through 5-10 pairs of running shoes a year, costing you somewhere from 500-2000 pounds a year without discounts. The `Â£60` I paid to run in Royal Parks was actually worth it just for the `15% off` coupon at a running shoe store.

### Next year

Not planning on dropping most of the volume yet, even though it's a bit much (and just doing a fraction of it will be enough stay healthy). I want to see how far I can stretch it for a bit more - while my age allows - given it's made me a lot healthier, sharper, and leaner. Also kind of want to train specifically for shorter distances like 1M / 3000 / 5k (do want to actually sub-19). However, beating PBs at this points does come with 8+ hours of mandatory training a week and injury risks so how much this is carried on next year is heavily conditional on nothing bad happening - a statement generally not served with good odds in the 2020s.

Probably will not plan for anything higher distance like marathons (even though my volume should be sufficient for tackling one) just because of how detrimental it seems to be to your overall [immune system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465622/) and how much recovery you need. My current line of thinking is; why train for 4 months for an even that takes you out of the game for 2-4 weeks? Better find a smooth average that you can sustain (he says while planning on beating PBs; requiring the opposite of smooth averages).

Anyway, it's been another fun side-project that's not been software related. It's been interested reading about [how professionals train](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00438-7), and hopefully will recover to run more in 2023.
