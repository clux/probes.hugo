As a more healthy habit, I ran a lot this year. Trained about half a year for Royal Parks Half Marthon (3 months mileage training and 3 months on a program) with an average mileage of 70km/w on the program. Also beat pretty much all my endurance records in the process. Post is just some stats for myself.

Year started slow. Increased fast without muscle training and ended up spending a lot more time on an elliptical in february.
When things stabilised I was able to raise the mileage quite a bit come summer (with an avg of 60k weekly in July). This gave me confidence to start a pretty ambitious plan for me from the end of july.

### London Parks Half Training

By many metrics I peaked nicely:

#### Paces:

- 3:32/km -> 17km/h ~= Z6 for mile?
- 3:45/km -> 16km/h ~= Z5 for 5k (18:45)
- 4:00/km -> 15km/h ~= Z4 for 10k (40:00)
- 4:16/km -> 14.1km/h ~= Z3 for HM (1:29:47)
- 5:00/km -> 12km/h ~= Z2


### Recovery

2 weeks of pretty low effort (40k, 50k), no speed, run every other day.

### Chiang Mai Half Training

- *1*: `6x1k` at 4:00, 67k


## Thoughts
The silliest things about this "accessible sport" is the amount of shoes you burn through.. If you run 100k a week, you'll blast through 5-10 pairs of running shoes a year, costing you somewhere from 500-2000 pounds a year without discounts.
