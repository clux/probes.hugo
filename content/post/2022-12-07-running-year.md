In an attempt to torture my chair shaped husk of a body, I somehow ran almost 2500km this year. Mostly to see what would happen, but also to take part in the [Royal Parks Half Marathon in London](https://www.royalparkshalf.com/).

## Milestones

In the process of going up to 70km weeks - something which became routine remarkably quickly - I ended up beating pretty much all of my endurance records:

- ~~[41:51 10k](https://www.strava.com/activities/7274508726)~~
- [39:29 10k](https://www.strava.com/activities/7750969909/overview)
- [11:15 3k](https://www.strava.com/activities/7878906931/overview)
- [1:29:34 HM](https://www.strava.com/activities/7934772777#21922284308)

The Half Marathon was my first longer event and feel I ran it well:

The 3k PB is also a `3200m` [Cooper test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_test) which, [heuristically](https://exrx.net/Calculators/MinuteRun), puts my VO2max above 60.

## Mileage

Garmin [report](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/report/17/all/last_year) for the year:

| Month | Mileage | VO2max |

| Jan   | 117k    | 51     |
| Feb   | 65k     | 52     |
| Mar   | 142k    | 53     |
| Apr   | 144k    | 54     |

## Q1/Q2

The year started slow, but increased a little too fast initially without muscle training and ended up spending a lot more time on an elliptical in February.
Back in London, when my foot muscles started catching up, I was able to raise the mileage quite a bit come summer (with an average of 60k weekly in July). This gave me confidence to start a pretty ambitious training plan from the end of July.

### Q3; London Parks Half Training

Combined ideas from two generally available training plans:

- [AgeUk's Sub 1:30 12w](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/contentassets/73784215f4ee46beb3d357eed3fdcc31/sub-1_30_half_marathon_training_schedules.pdf) - for general setup, but taking out some of the races
- [NSPCC Sub 1:30 14w](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/support-us/training-gym/running-plans/half-marathon/20171301-pe-training-sheet-2018_half-marathon-sub-1.30-aw2.pdf) - for negative split long runs and more thresholds

also incorporated ~two sessions of muscle strength training a week (single leg dead lifts, weighted squats, hungarian squats, heel/soleus raises, plus misc core/oblique strength exercises).

Ended up averaging `71k` weekly mileage during this block.

| Week | Mileage | VO2max | Fast %    |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | --------- |
| *1*  | 60k     | 56     | 6k (10%)  |
| *2*  | 61k     | 56     | 7k (11%)  |
| *3*  | 66k     | 56     | 11k (17%) |
| *4*  | 67k     | 57     | 14k (20%) |
| *5*  | 74k     | 57     | 13k (17%) |

| *8*  | 79k     | 57     | 10k (13%) |
| *9*  | 77k     | 57     | 17k (22%) |
| *10* | 89k     | 58     | 24k (27%) |
| *11* | 79k     | 58     | 17k (21%) |
| *12* | 57k     | 58     | 24k (42%) |

By many metrics (Garmin VO2max estimate, Strava fitness), I peaked nicely for the race:

![Strava fitness graph climbing from 15 to 34 in a year, peaking at 34 at the half marathon day](/imgs/running22/fitness-hm.png)

and ended up feeling OK after the race. One blood-shot big toenail (which i could show off for a whole year - if such a thing was considered cool).

#### Pace Zones

Calculated the following zonal pace estimates for me based on the general fitness during this time:

- 3:32/km -> 17km/h ~= Z6 for mile?
- 3:45/km -> 16km/h ~= Z5 for 5k (18:45)
- 4:00/km -> 15km/h ~= Z4 for 10k (40:00)
- 4:16/km -> 14.1km/h ~= Z3 for HM (1:29:47)
- 5:00/km -> 12km/h ~= Z2

#### Recovery

2 weeks of pretty low effort (40k, 50k), no speed, run every other day.

### Chiang Mai Half Training

Second block. 8w. A bit of an impromptu registration, and a bit of fun that to test how my training translate across continents to a new humid environment. Unfortunately, this block got cancelled near the end.

- *1*: [`6x1k` at 4:00/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8016708080), [19k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8042805169), 67k
- *2*: [`7x1k` at 3:57/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8052372984), [21k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8071743943), 80k (last in London)
- *3*: [`3.5x1M` at 4:05/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8084716741), [700m climb long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8109412998), 72k (Chiang Mai)
- *4*: [`4x1M` at 4:05/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8124189835), [20k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8142151676), 85k
- *5*: [`4x1M` at 4:03/km](https://www.strava.com/activities/8155702793), [22k long](https://www.strava.com/activities/8173542205), 92k
- *6*: 8K recovery week, [`8k` MAF test](https://www.strava.com/activities/8187100758), and covid ðŸª¦, 38k

Two weeks ahead of the race.. The r/advanced_running subreddit had [ample](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/xr60mg/an_athletes_guide_to_managing_covid_risks_by_matt/), [warnings](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/yn5ypp/tested_covid_positive_10_days_before_a_marathon/) about running hard post-covid.

On the positive side, with an ungodly `4AM start` for this race and a `90%` average humidity (which tanked my running efficiency); having to cancel a difficult masochistic exercise you set purely for yourself is not universally a negative.

### Covid

Unfortunately, it had been one full year since my last (3rd) vaccination shot - and along with probably being hit with one of the `Q` variants in southeast asia - this disease was not fun. Just as one symptom disappeared another came in to replace it.

While **my** stress graph on the worst day looked pretty benign (mostly medium stress), my partner's stress graph on Garmin was the worst I have ever seen (with >10 hours of high stress in one day). Still, the fever was pretty bad for me, and am now getting light headed doing easy things 6 days on, so it's definitely not "just a cold".

BMJ has a [Graduated Return To Play Guidance Protocol](https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2022/04/23/graduated-return-to-play-after-sars-cov-2-infection-what-have-we-learned-and-why-weve-updated-the-guidance/) and based on only having some "below-the-neck" systemic symptoms (fever), I am only planning on doing light jogging during the second half of December if/once ðŸ¤ž it's possible to:

> complete all activities of daily living without excessive fatigue and/or breathlessness and be able to walk on the flat without getting breathless

So, yeah. Use your masks while indoors people. [Each time you get reinfected, the risks increase](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/repeat-covid-is-riskier-than-first-infection-study-finds-2022-11-10/).

## Random Thoughts
### Next year

Provided recovery allows; I hope to keep the volume, even though it's a bit much (and just doing a fraction of it will be enough stay healthy). I want to see how far I can stretch it for a bit longer given it's made me a lot healthier, sharper, and leaner.

Also kind of want to train specifically for shorter distances like 1M / 3000 / 5k, even though beating PBs at this points does come with 8+ hours of mandatory training a week and injury risks so how much this is carried on next year is heavily conditional on nothing bad happening - a statement generally not served with good odds in the 2020s.

Not planning on higher distance events like marathons just because of how detrimental it seems to be to your overall [immune system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465622/) and how much recovery you need. My current line of thinking is; why train for 4 months for an event that takes you out of the game for 2-4 weeks? Better find a smooth average that you can sustain.

> brain: he says this while planning on beating PBs; requiring the opposite of smooth averages.

Anyway, it's been another fun side-project that's not been software related. It's been interested reading about [how professionals train](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00438-7), and seeing effects first hand.

### Shoes

The silliest thing about this __accessible sport__ though; is the amount of shoes you burn through. If you run `100k` a week, and follow the [500-800k](https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a33233314/how-many-miles-do-running-shoes-last/) recommendation for max shoe mileage, you'll blast through 5-10 pairs of running shoes a year, costing you somewhere from `Â£500-2000` per year for high end shoes. The `Â£60` I paid to run in Royal Parks was actually worth it just for the `15% off` coupon at a running shoe store.

On the plus side, at least I'm not an elitist playing golf.
