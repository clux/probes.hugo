In a more light-hearted post, thought I would list my favourite pieces of technical violin music (grouped by my favourite performer of them) as it's violin competition season.

## Disclaimer
Highly subjective. Recording quality matters, and this will exclude some bad audio quality recordings provided there are something that can replicate the technique.

## Chloe Chua

[Chloe Chua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Chua) plays so cleanly (and is so depressingly young), won the Menuhin competition in 2018 (when she was 11), and has some absolutely stunningly performed pieces of some of the most technical pieces around (by composers such as Sarasate, Ysaye, Piazzolla)

### Ysaye - Sonata in D Minor, Ballade, Op. 27, No. 3

{{< youtube klnOLb_VBQ >}}

I did not expect a 16 year old to create my favourite recording of this piece, but this is right up there with Ibragimova's recording (which you won't find on youtube),

### Sarasate - Caprice Basque Op. 24

{{< youtube ATrH52RjDsM >}}



## Clara-Jumi Kang

### Carmen Fantasy

{{< youtube 0UoTMCPkMp8 >}}

What an energy this recording has. Deep sound, near flawless clarity, and hitting all of those crucial jumps at crazy speed in the last movement.


## Hilary Hahn

There's really too many to list here. Hahn has been one of the most impressive performers of the century. Her Bach recordings, and flawless renditions of many of the greatest concert works makes it hard to pick out just a few.

### Bach - Chaconne

{{< youtube ngjEVKxQCWs >}}

### Sibelius Violin Concerto

{{< youtube DpbTHQn7RP8 >}}

## Midori

Regrettably have not heard much from her on youtube apart from her legendary Carnegie Hall performance in 1990 (and the picks here are all from there).

### Ravel - Tzigane

{{< youtube wn0XkLAM8eE >}}

[Maria Duenas' performance at Menuhin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbWV7fTIooQ) is also right up there.


### Ernst - The Last Rose of Summer

{{< youtube uA0ugX-v5NU >}}

An absolutely stupid piece crammed full of the most obscene techniques such as fast moving artificial harmonic chords, fast moving thirds or arpeggios while doing left hand pizzicato, artificial harmonics as the hidden melody in an arpeggio with left hand pizzicato. On top of this, you probably won't even like this piece unless you appreciate complexity for complexity's sake.

It is so difficult that if you find professionals playing it, they generally make a lot of mistakes because the piece is basically impossible to play. Somehow Midory does a near perfect rendition live. But don't take my word for it. Read the comments.

## Julia Fischer

Out of all the performers, Julia has probably the most laser focused stare of all.
I had the pleasure of seeing her live in London in 2017 when she blasted through all of the Ysaye sonatas.

### Handel-Halvorsen Passacaglia

{{<  youtube qNsxXued784 >}}

Often played with violin and viola, but this pairing is beautiful and is just the right amount of aggressive.

The quality of the recording is a bit lacking, so a good studio recording would be [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HILw4wiKjdY), but it's not as technically impressive nor interesting.


### Dvorak Violin Concerto in A Minor, Op. 53

{{< youtube 9rAd0-pTuU8 >}}

Beautiful Proms recording from 2014 with a beautiful Cadenza. Also don't miss the less common but beautiful Hindemith encore.


fuck me hahn's one is amazing as well! more clarity but timing does feel a bit off.

## Augustin Hadelich

Amazingly precise violinist that has a huge collection of technical works on youtube. Lots of Ysaye and Paganini, and he has some of the best performed versions of them I've heard.

He also has a video performing Saint Saens's Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2LYsNujdG0)

### Ysaye 4
{{< youtube qwURbkxB4SU >}}
the speed and clarity of the final movement is just unparallelled.

## ???

### Ysaye - Caprice d'Apres l'Etude en forme de Valse de Saint-Saens

vengerov's is great (but orchestral)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFCHjFfqbJE
it is an isolated recording though

inmo yang plays it amazingly in the Menuhin competition in 2014.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3hN0ShdBLE
the end is just so difficult and he absolutely nails it, beautiful clarity on that crucial left hand pizzicato. maybe the audience member jumping in to clap early destressed him (this [keeps happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agd-_BEEoM4) in this piece).

### Saint Saens - Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCsB3WtlyaM
same as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdzhmYG38EE ?
by [Yuuna Shinohara](https://nexushall.chanel.com/en/artists/yuna_shinohara/), a highly decorated yet probably not very well known artist in the west. Know nothing about this artist, but it's by fas the best recording out there.
there are full orchestral versions of this (by e.g. [Perlman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnsPnyiLdrw), [CJK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW-ahsAVct8)) that are good, but there's something great about the simplicity about just a violin and a grand.
