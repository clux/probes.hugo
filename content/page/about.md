Hello. My name is `Eirik` and this is an attempt to collect my thoughts, and provide the occasional guide to software.

Below contains a bit about me and a brief summary and status of various creative and dexterous endeavours that I am generally happy to spend / have spent time on. The alternate category of endeavours that were a complete waste of time, or things I am remarkably bad at for my age is a much larger and more depressing list, and is left as an exercise to the reader to imagine.

### Software
For a living, I help automate software operations of modern businesses. Generally, this means integrating existing cloud technologies on kubernetes (`yaml` surgery), but occasionally someting new gets written. Last [six](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager/commit/5247fb2755cf936a81ed9e82ff6b7bbc0af8a03a) years have featured a lot of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) due to its safety guarantees and great ecosystem, but [also like to dabble](https://github.com/clux/magic-forest).

From my [github](https://github.com/clux?tab=repositories):

- [kube](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube) :: a kubernetes client and controller runtime for rust
- [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) :: a `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build image for the cloud
- [tournament](https://github.com/clux/tournament) :: a suite of modules for managing state and lifecycles of competitions


These days, **[kube](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube)** - which has grown from a personal yak to a cornerstone of the kubernetes rust ecosystem - takes most of my available open source times. See the [kubernetes tagged posts](/tags/kubernetes) for that.

Past colleagues might remember me from these overly ambitious work projects:

- 2018 [babylon/shipcat](https://github.com/clux/shipcat) :: a typed config management system for kubernetes microservices (a deployment tool they liked so much, [they un-opensourced it](https://twitter.com/sszynrae/status/1522589153384349697))
- 2016 [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) :: a language agnostic build system (the [old build team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people) technically has a [fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal), but most of our `C` days are over)

### Roleplaying

After having spent one christmas sick binging Critical Role, I ended up DMing a near 4 year D&D campaign after work. This [concluded](/post/2021-12-05-campaign-concluded/) in pandemic times, and was a large part of my sanity in that period. Am currently absolved from further dubious plot juggling and a campaign related [todos](https://github.com/clux/facemaulers/search?q=TODO), but plan on resuming [roleplaying](/categories/roleplaying/) shenanigans at some point.

### Education
There exists a dusty, but laminated piece of paper with `Master of Mathematics` on it. While no one has ever asked to look at it, it keeps being featured on my [resume](http://clux.github.io/vitae/).

This esoteric + deteriorating knowledge is mostly used to overexcitedly tell people about group theory, and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all; a solid use of `4` years.

### Music

As a kid, I played violin for a decade. Have got a couple of things to show for this; near perfect recollection of the solo-violinists repertoire, an intense desire to follow violin competitions, and a history of being a good target for bullying.

Nowadays, my [2017 p-series](https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/index.html) is my weapon of choice, and is helping me recover from violin trauma. It also continues my habit of committing useless chunks of finger movement to muscle memory, but comes with the side-effect of making me watch piano competitions.

<small>If you are considering buying a violin for yourself/someone. Buy an `otamatone` first to see if you think you can [handle](https://www.stoppingpoints.com/devils-dictionary/fiddle.html) listening to someone wrangling with a fretless, non-linear interface for years. The instrument UX is terrible. You deserve better.</small>

### Gaming
Well designed game mechanics that require some type of dexterous mastery, or hit a particularly large nerd-sniping target, have frequently drawn me in. Here's some stuff I spent time on over the years..
