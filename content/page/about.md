My name is Eirik and this is an attempt to collect my thoughts.

Why **you** are here is a mystery. Perhaps you are lost, or perhaps I shameless posted an article to reddit. At any rate, please remember that facebook or reddit isn't going to continue to check itself.

## History
Below contains a brief summary and current status of various creative and dexterous endeavours that I am generally happy to have spent time on.

The alternate category of endeavours that were a complete waste of time, or things I am remarkably bad at for my age is a much larger and more depressing list, and is left as an exercise to the reader to imagine.


### Software
I integrate cloud technologies for work, which is a fancy way to say that I combine documents in `yaml` format, and people consider this expertise.

Regardless, a lot of it is effectively uncharted experimentation territory, and you can't help but feel both lucky and cursed to be in it at the same time: shiny tech, few stackoverflow answers.

Projects I've been the main architect of include:

- [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) - a strict, language agnostic build system (the [old buid team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people) have a [fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal))
- [babylon/shipcat](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/shipcat) - a microservice lifecycle manager for kubernetes

There are also numerous smaller projects under my [github account](https://github.com/clux?tab=repositories) that solve some problems. In particular:

- [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) - a canonical `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` rust build image for the cloud
- [tournament](https://github.com/clux/tournament) - a suite of modules for managing state and lifecycles of competitions

A recent trend is heavy usage of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) due to its safety guarantees and slow compile times, but [I like to dabble](https://github.com/clux/magic-forest).

### Mathematics
There is a dusty piece of paper somewhere that says my name and `Master of Mathematics` on it. See [vitae](http://clux.github.io/vitae/) for details.

This esoteric knowledge is mostly used to overexcitedly tell people about infinities and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all, a solid use of 4 years.

Almost got on the PhD train, but then people were shouting `4 more years` so much in America that the whole concept of time was scaring me.

### Dungeon Mastering
I run a forgotten realms style campaign based on [Out of the Abyss](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/outoftheabyss) wherein a bunch of humans remarkably continue to tolerate my antics and bad improv. My dungeon design and mechanics aren't too bad anymore though!

Underlings; here is the [private link to the dndbeyond campaign](https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/156017).

### Music
Played `violin` from age `~7-17`, seeded by my luthier grandfather. Enjoyed the indoctrination of baroque + romantic music in a youth orchestra and took lessons for solo pieces for years. If anything, it makes you appreciate it when music actually contains a melody that cannot be hummed in a minute.

Have had a few on-years where this skill has been resurrected, but the muscle memory the instrument demands feels too high maintenance to be compatible with work and any other spare time activities atm.

Started playing `piano` in the summer of 2017 loosely thaught by my brother and the internet.

### Gaming
Games that feature some type of dexterous mastery with intuitive understanding have always interested me. Below are some games that drew my attention and caused a couple of historical links tied to my name.

#### Quake 3
Played this for years online. Joined `VSE`, played for `Team Norway` in ClanBase tournaments, and later started `GULL` and a quake 3 division of [X-Pec](http://www.chicksdigx-pec.com).

- Made [Smooth Frags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD3aTJ_jzL8), [numbar 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXCJpkv0GuI), and [numbar 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHfSKhvzogM) - Quake 3 highlight clips
- Won The Gathering Quake 3 1v1 Competition in 2005

Kept sparring in [promode](https://playmorepromode.com/) after q3 mostly died. Much later returned to compile [discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liSxP2j5b60) from 2008 matches.

#### Random
- Held numerous WRs in [N](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/games/n) - `70-0` was voted [run of the year](http://n.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dronies) by the community - and took [nearly 8 years to beat](http://ploudseeker.com:5000/all_scores?level=70-0&place=0) - [N wiki entry](http://n.wikia.com/wiki/Clux)
- Gained the `Minesweeper` [#2 rank in Norway](http://www.minesweeper.info/countryranking.html?country=132) with a [`53s` on expert](http://www.minesweeper.info/members/files/3552/EirikAlbrigtsen54,49-119-110607.mvf) (top 200 world)
- Hold the speedrun record WR in `Trine` for [fastest segmented NG+](http://speeddemosarchive.com/Trine.html) of `Trine` ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45T7-Avb5vQ&list=PLDCA837F2416D427B))
- Found a [mathematical solution to a ridiculous dungeon](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2006-08-09-vault-of-therayne/) in `Dungeon Siege 2`
- Held stunt/platform mode WRs in `TrackMania United` - [tmx](https://united.tm-exchange.com/main.aspx?action=tracksearch&mode=7&id=1273332)
- Completed all iron man runs in `Super Meat Boy`: [Cotton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZeFFwkCLN8) / [Dark Cotton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgptqlVQGSM)
- Completed [all char runs](https://crypt.toofz.com/p/76561198007590148/classic) in [Necrodancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/), and have [bolt low% clears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1d6hoN9DoM)

#### Current
These days it's mostly casual **cooperative** gaming. [Have had a lot of fun in `TF2` with weird weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVzOLtpO6fU&list=PL4gj5XjL6RRQecS059_tjxRQ4Lu6yUNqB), but also have `OP8` kitted characters in `Borderlands 2`. Limited to [Steam on Linux](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sszynrae) atm, but maybe trying [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) in the future.
