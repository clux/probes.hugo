My name is Eirik and this is an attempt to collect my thoughts, and provide the occasional guide to software.

Posts herein are my own opinions and not those of my employer.

Below contains a bit about who I am / what I have done / like to do. I.e. a brief summary and status of various creative and dexterous endeavours that I am generally happy to spend / have spent time on.

The alternate category of endeavours that were a complete waste of time, or things I am remarkably bad at for my age is a much larger and more depressing list, and is left as an exercise to the reader to imagine.

### Software
I integrate cloud technologies for work, which is a fancy way to say that I combine documents in `yaml` format, and people consider this expertise.

Regardless, a lot of it is effectively uncharted experimentation territory, and you can't help but feel both lucky and cursed to be in it at the same time: shiny tech, few stackoverflow answers.

Big projects I've been heavily involved in include:

- [babylon/shipcat](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/shipcat) - a config management system for kubernetes microservices
- [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) - a strict, language agnostic build system (the [old build team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people) have a [fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal))

There are also numerous smaller projects under my [github account](https://github.com/clux?tab=repositories) that solve some problems. In particular:

- [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) - a canonical `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` rust build image for the cloud
- [tournament](https://github.com/clux/tournament) - a suite of modules for managing state and lifecycles of competitions

A recent trend is heavy usage of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) due to its safety guarantees and slow compile times, but [I like to dabble](https://github.com/clux/magic-forest).

### Mathematics
There exists a dusty piece with my name and  `Master of Mathematics` on it. While no one has ever asked to look at, it does feature on my [resume](http://clux.github.io/vitae/), as well as giving `+5` to saves vs. bad mathematics.

This esoteric knowledge is mostly used to overexcitedly tell people about infinities and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all, a solid use of __\*\*chanting\*\*__ `4 more years`.

### Dungeon Mastering
I run a forgotten realms style D&D campaign based on [Out of the Abyss](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/outoftheabyss) wherein a bunch of humans continue to tolerate my antics and bad improv. [Campaign links for underlings](https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/156017).

### Music
Played the bastard instrument the `violin` from age `~7-17`, so there'll be some opinions on non-linear interfaces and muscle memory here and there. Oh, and I can neighbour worse than you can.

These days, badly playing `piano` satisfies my habit of committing useless chunks of knowledge to muscle memory.

### Gaming
Games that feature some type of dexterous mastery with intuitive understanding have always interested me. Below are some games that drew my attention and caused a couple of historical links tied to my name.

#### Quake 3
Played this for years online. Joined `VSE`, played for `Team Norway` in ClanBase tournaments, and later started `GULL` and a quake 3 division of [X-Pec](http://www.chicksdigx-pec.com).

- Made [Smooth Frags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD3aTJ_jzL8), [numbar 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXCJpkv0GuI), and [numbar 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHfSKhvzogM) - Quake 3 highlight clips
- Won The Gathering Quake 3 1v1 Competition in 2005

Kept sparring in [promode](https://playmorepromode.com/) after q3 mostly died. Much later returned to compile [discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liSxP2j5b60) from 2008 matches.

#### Random

- Held numerous WRs in [N](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/games/n) - `70-0` was voted [run of the year](http://n.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dronies) by the community - and took [nearly 8 years to beat](http://ploudseeker.com:5000/all_scores?level=70-0&place=0) - [N wiki entry](http://n.wikia.com/wiki/Clux)
- Gained the `Minesweeper` [#2 rank in Norway](http://www.minesweeper.info/countryranking.html?country=132) with a [`53s` on expert](http://www.minesweeper.info/members/files/3552/EirikAlbrigtsen54,49-119-110607.mvf) (top 200 world)
- Found a [mathematical solution to a ridiculous dungeon](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2006-08-09-vault-of-therayne/) in `Dungeon Siege 2`
- Held stunt/platform mode WRs in `TrackMania United` - [tmx](https://united.tm-exchange.com/main.aspx?action=tracksearch&mode=7&id=1273332)
- Hold the speedrun record WR in `Trine` for [fastest segmented NG+](http://speeddemosarchive.com/Trine.html) of `Trine` ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45T7-Avb5vQ&list=PLDCA837F2416D427B))
- Completed all iron man runs in `Super Meat Boy`: [Cotton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZeFFwkCLN8) / [Dark Cotton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgptqlVQGSM)
- Completed [all char runs](https://crypt.toofz.com/p/76561198007590148/classic) in [Necrodancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/), and have [bolt low% clears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1d6hoN9DoM)

#### Current
These days it's mostly casual **cooperative** gaming. [Have had a lot of fun in `TF2` with weird weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVzOLtpO6fU&list=PL4gj5XjL6RRQecS059_tjxRQ4Lu6yUNqB), but also have `OP8` kitted characters in `Borderlands 2`. Limited to [Steam on Linux](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sszynrae) atm, but maybe trying [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) in the future.
