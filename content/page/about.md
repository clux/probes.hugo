Hello. My name is `Eirik` and this is an attempt to collect my thoughts, and provide the occasional guide to software.

Below contains a bit about me and a brief summary and status of various creative and dexterous endeavours that I am generally happy to have spent time on. The alternate category of endeavours that were a complete waste of time, or things I am remarkably bad at for my age is a much larger and more depressing list, and is left as an exercise to the reader to imagine.

### Software
For a living, I help automate various operational issues in modern software businesses. Generally, this means integrating existing cloud technologies on kubernetes (merging `yaml`), but occasionally we write someting new. Last [five](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager/commit/5247fb2755cf936a81ed9e82ff6b7bbc0af8a03a) years I have generally reached for [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for solutions due to its safety guarantees and great library ecosystem, but [I also like to dabble](https://github.com/clux/magic-forest).

Some fun, public work projects I've been heavily involved in include:

- [babylonhealth/shipcat](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/shipcat) :: a typed config management system for kubernetes microservices (pretty babylon specific)
- [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) :: a language agnostic build system (the [old build team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people) have a [fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal))

Then personal projects through my [github account](https://github.com/clux?tab=repositories):

- [kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs) :: a kubernetes api client and controller runtime for rust
- [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) :: a `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build image for the cloud
- [tournament](https://github.com/clux/tournament) :: a suite of modules for managing state and lifecycles of competitions


These days, **[kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs)**, which has grown from a personal yak to a cornerstone of the kubernetes rust ecosystem, takes most of my available open source times. See the [kubernetes tagged posts](/tags/kubernetes) for that.

### Dungeon Mastering
I roleplay with a bunch of friends online, and somehow managed to complete a forgotten realms style `D&D` campaign based on [Out of the Abyss](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/outoftheabyss). It continues to be a wonder to me that there exists a bunch of humans that can continue to tolerate my antics and bad improv for over 3 years. The long campaign is organised in my [campaign repo](https://github.com/clux/campaign).

### Music
Bought a piano in 2017 and am finding it very soothing and meditative to play from classical sheet music. It also satisfies my earlier gaming habit of committing useless chunks of finger movement to muscle memory.

Helps a bit to have recovered from violin trauma from age `~7-17`. Instrument UX ought to be a thing; if you are considering buying a violin; buy an `otamatone` first to see if you think you can [handle](https://www.stoppingpoints.com/devils-dictionary/fiddle.html) listening to you/someone wrangling with a fretless, non-linear interface for years.

### Mathematics
There exists a dusty, but laminated piece of paper with my name +  `Master of Mathematics` on it. While no one has ever asked to look at it, it keeps being featured on my [resume](http://clux.github.io/vitae/) every `n` years.

This esoteric + deteriorating knowledge is mostly used to overexcitedly tell people about infinities and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all, a solid use of `4` years.

### Gaming
Well designed game mechanics that require some type of dexterous mastery have often drawn me in. Here's some stuff I spent time on over the years..
