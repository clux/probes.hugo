My name is Eirik and this is an attempt to collect my thoughts.


## History
Below contains a brief summary and current status of variour creative and dexterous endeavours.

### Software
Work involves a lot of unsolved integration work around cloud computing, and a lot of what I do is effectively uncharted experimentation territory. It's a situation that you feel both lucky and cursed to be in at the same time: shiny tech, few stackoverflow answers.

Projects I've been the main architect of include:

- [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) - a strict, language agnostic build system (the [old buid team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people) have a [fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal))
- [babylon/shipcat](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/shipcat) - a microservice lifecycle manager for kubernetes

There are also numerous smaller projects under my [github account](https://github.com/clux?tab=repositories) that solve real problems. In particular:

- [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) - a canonical `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` rust build image for the cloud
- [tournament](https://github.com/clux/tournament) - a suite of modules for managing state and lifecycles of competitions

### Dungeon Mastering
A newish venture. The main focal point is my forgotten realms style campaign based on [Out of the Abyss](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/outoftheabyss) and it's a real blast to get together and cooperate creatively whilest having fun. Posts probably to come here. [Private link to dndbeyond campaign](https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/156017).

### Music
Played `violin` from age `~7-18` as my grandfather was a luthier. Played tons of classical chamber music and orchestral pieces with a youth orchestra and took lessons for solo pieces for years.

Have had a few on-years where this has been resurrected, but the muscle memory the instrument demands is too high maintenance to be compatible with work and any other spare time.

Started playing `piano` in the summer of 2017 loosely thaught by my brother and the internet.

### Gaming
Games that feature some type of dexterous mastery with intuitive understanding have always interested me. Below are some games that drew my attention and caused a couple of googleable events tied to my name.

#### Quake 3
Played this for years online. Joined `VSE`, played for `Team Norway` in ClanBase tournaments, and later started `GULL` and a quake 3 division of [X-Pec](http://www.chicksdigx-pec.com).

- Made [Smooth Frags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD3aTJ_jzL8), [numbar 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXCJpkv0GuI), and [numbar 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHfSKhvzogM) - Quake 3 highlight clips
- Won The Gathering Quake 3 1v1 Competition in 2005

Kept sparring in [promode](https://playmorepromode.com/) after q3 mostly died. Later back and compiled [discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liSxP2j5b60) from 2008 matches.

#### Random
- Held numerous WRs in [N](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/games/n) - `70-0` was voted [run of the year](http://n.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dronies) by the community - and took [8 years to beat](http://ploudseeker.com:5000/all_scores?level=70-0&place=0) - [N wiki entry](http://n.wikia.com/wiki/Clux)
- Gained the `Minesweeper` [#2 rank in Norway](http://www.minesweeper.info/countryranking.html?country=132) with a [`53s` on expert](http://www.minesweeper.info/members/files/3552/EirikAlbrigtsen54,49-119-110607.mvf) (top 200 world)
- Hold the speedrun record in `Trine` for [fastest segmented NG+](http://speeddemosarchive.com/Trine.html) of `Trine` ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45T7-Avb5vQ&list=PLDCA837F2416D427B))
- Found a mathematical solution to a ridiculous dungeon in `Dungeon Siege 2`
- Held stunt/platform mode WRs in `TrackMania United` - [tmx](https://united.tm-exchange.com/main.aspx?action=tracksearch&mode=7&id=1273332)
- Completed all iron man runs in `Super Meat Boy`: [Cotton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZeFFwkCLN8) / [Dark Cotton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgptqlVQGSM)
- Made numerous [clips using weird weapons in `TF2`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVzOLtpO6fU&list=PL4gj5XjL6RRQecS059_tjxRQ4Lu6yUNqB)
- Completed [all char runs](https://crypt.toofz.com/p/76561198007590148/classic) in [Necrodancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/), and have [bolt low% clears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1d6hoN9DoM)

#### Current
These days it's much more casual and can probably be found playing borderlands or an old Obsidian classic with friends on [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sszynrae)
