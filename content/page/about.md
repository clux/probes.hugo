Hello. My name is `Eirik` and this is an attempt to collect my thoughts, and provide the occasional guide to software.

Below contains a bit about me and a brief summary and status of various creative and dexterous endeavours that I am generally happy to spend / have spent time on. The alternate category of endeavours that were a complete waste of time, or things I am remarkably bad at for my age is a much larger and more depressing list, and is left as an exercise to the reader to imagine.

### Software
For a living, I help automate software operations of modern businesses. Generally, this means integrating existing cloud technologies on kubernetes (merging `yaml`), but occasionally someting new gets written. Last [five](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager/commit/5247fb2755cf936a81ed9e82ff6b7bbc0af8a03a) years have featured a lot of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) due to its safety guarantees and great ecosystem, but [also like to dabble](https://github.com/clux/magic-forest).

From my [github](https://github.com/clux?tab=repositories):

- [kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs) :: a kubernetes api client and controller runtime for rust
- [muslrust](https://github.com/clux/muslrust) :: a `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` build image for the cloud
- [tournament](https://github.com/clux/tournament) :: a suite of modules for managing state and lifecycles of competitions


These days, **[kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs)** - which has grown from a personal yak to a cornerstone of the kubernetes rust ecosystem - takes most of my available open source times. See the [kubernetes tagged posts](/tags/kubernetes) for that.

Work-wise, you might remember me from these open source projects:

- 2018 [babylon/shipcat](https://github.com/babylonhealth/shipcat) :: a typed config management system for kubernetes microservices (pretty babylon specific, but helped us control early gitops)
- 2016 [cisco/lal](https://github.com/cisco/lal-build-manager) :: a language agnostic build system (the [old build team](https://github.com/orgs/lalbuild/people) have a [fork](https://github.com/lalbuild/lal), but haven't needed it much since rust)


### Education
There exists a dusty, but laminated piece of paper with my name +  `Master of Mathematics` on it. While no one has ever asked to look at it, it keeps being featured on my [resume](http://clux.github.io/vitae/) every `n` years.

This esoteric + deteriorating knowledge is mostly used to overexcitedly tell people about infinities and the importance of good abstractions, but I also solve basic arithmetic at work. All in all, a solid use of `4` years.

### Roleplaying
A group uncommonly known as the `Face Maulers` continues meet near-weekly online to tolerate my awkward DM antics/improv after several years. This started out as an after work thing - after having spent a christmas sick binging Critical Role - but in pandemic times it has migrated to a private `D&D` discord in pandemic times, and this setup is very nice. Occasionally, [posts occur in this category](/categories/roleplaying/).

The big 3.5 year campaign just ended, and at some point, my [campaign repo](https://github.com/clux/campaign) will be public.

### Music
Bought a [piano](https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/index.html) in 2017 after having fully recovered from violin trauma. It is very soothing and meditative to play something mindlessly from classical sheet music when you need a break. It also helps satisfies my habit of committing useless chunks of finger movement to muscle memory.

If you are considering buying a violin for yourself/someone. Buy an `otamatone` first to see if you think you can [handle](https://www.stoppingpoints.com/devils-dictionary/fiddle.html) listening to someone wrangling with a fretless, non-linear interface for years. The instrument UX is terrible. You deserve better.

### Gaming
Well designed game mechanics that require some type of dexterous mastery have often drawn me in. Here's some stuff I spent time on over the years..

#### Current
These days it's generally tabletop, but some **cooperative** gaming and platformers remain fun. [Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sszynrae). [Linux only](https://store.steampowered.com/linux), but with [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton).
